  BlochSphere.ipynb is graphic for creation of Bloch Spheres
  Basics.ipynb is for the basic representation of qubits (probability, Bloch Spheres)
  Entanglement.ipynb basic quantum network (two qubits) for explaining Entanglement, contains Bloch Spheres, State Vectors, Qspheres
 
Note that all these examples are based on IBM quiskit- see https://qiskit.org/textbook/what-is-quantum.html for details.
A new version is under https://qiskit.org/textbook-beta/, but most of the examples are based on the old version of the textbook.

The qiskit software package is open source and available from https://qiskit.org/
